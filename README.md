We are performing sentiment analysis on the Sentiment140 Dataset which contains 1.6 million tweets.
To execute this code, download the Sentiment140 dataset.

I have used NLP(Natural Language Processing) for cleaning and tokenizing the dataset.
Ensure that you have all the necessary python packages installed.
